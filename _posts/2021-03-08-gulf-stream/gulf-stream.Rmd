title: "Gulf stream"
description: |
  A weakening gulf stream has been a convern in Europe for a number of years, one that is not talked about a lot in American media. The gulf stream is what makes for such mild weather in Europe, so it's kind of a big deal. [Now we see new negative records.](https://www.livescience.com/gulf-stream-slowing-climate-change.html) That's more than a  bit concerning. Not only would it mean colder winters in Europe, but also more extreme weather on both sides of the Atlantic (think hurricane season).
