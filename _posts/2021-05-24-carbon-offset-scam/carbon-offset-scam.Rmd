title: "Carbon offset (scam?)"
description: |
  [Great piece by Bloomberg on the problems associated with carbon offset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20xMbGkEIQI)--I think a lot of use have heard about this, and how the reality is a little questionable, so I am glad to finally hear a more detailed story on this. Seems like in particular The Nature Conservacy is glad to exaggerate their accomplishments a little bit in exchange for conservation work funding from big corporations--but really, "we will not chop down this forest, and that's how the we reduce carbon emissions"... not a good story. Meanwhile, the land has been owned by The Nature Conservacy all along. And of course that means their customers don't really need to change anything about how their businesses work, while claiming the big green zero--convenient. Of course the fact that the rules of carbon accounting allow for that in the first place is concerning. Looking at you, American Carbon Registry.
