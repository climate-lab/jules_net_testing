title: "Montana's efforts to revive Keystone XL"
description: |
  I have had this one on my desk for a while. [Montana is now actively trying to revive Keystone XL](https://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/montana-delegation-demands-keystone-xl-pipeline-project-be-revived/article_0aa74db2-3bf9-534d-94db-eb87d7bafc3a.html). [Also on board: 20 other republican states](https://thehill.com/changing-america/sustainability/energy/543913-21-states-sue-biden-for-cancelling-keystone-xl). This highlights an interesting dimension that Keystone XL will take in the future. It is not over, yet. It also highlights the role that states such as Montana take. Maybe the default position would be to believe that states are arbitrators in the process, checkin the merits of a project before approving it. The reality is probably that individual decision makers--not in all cases, but often enough--act as active cheerleaders for projects such as Keystone XL.
