title: "Fierce resistance cannot prevent pipeline project"
description: |
  [Interesting report in the Boston Globe about the construction of a compressor station](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/12/12/metro/was-it-ever-fair-fight/). Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker was determined to approve the project, it seems. This story raises the question of what factors determine whether a pipeline project is approved. Since their 1999 policy revision, [FERC has approved 400 applications for pipeline projects, and has rejected only 2](https://www.analysisgroup.com/uploadedfiles/content/insights/publishing/ag_ferc_natural_gas_pipeline_certification.pdf). There are public input opportunities built into the certification process, but in practice these only serve to "inform" the public of a decision that has already been made.
