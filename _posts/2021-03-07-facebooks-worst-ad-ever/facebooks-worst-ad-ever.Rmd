title: "Facebook's worst ad ever"
description: |
  Not related to what I am usually interested in, but still. [Facebook's ad that wants to convince you to opt into tracking on iOS.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRABUy6G2GY) God. I don't know why it gives me such creepy vibes. The music. The visuals. The 1984-esque message. What a terrible ad.
