title: "Keystone XL documentary"
description: |
  [Bloomberg just released this short documentary about Keystone XL on their Youtube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6QvM5Heewo) Nicely summarizes some of its history, and interesting interviewees. [This is another documentary I just watched, about a well that has been spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico since 2004.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztT45A501Tc) The company behind it displays an incredibly cynical attitude, good reminder why it is worth digging deeper on the oil & gas industry.
