title: "Starfish extinction event"
description: |
  Not exactly on top of the news, but still important: [There was/is a starfish mass extinction event going on since 2013, with starfishes seemingly "dissolving".](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/science/sea-stars-genes.html) Now [researchers](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.610009) have found a likely explanation: [microbial activity under conditions of overfertilization](https://www.spektrum.de/news/bakterien-und-ueberduengung-lassen-seesterne-zu-schleim-werden/1822031). It wouldn't be the first case of fertilizer runoff causing terrifying events. [I hope everybody remembers the toxic algea bloom off the coast of Florida.](https://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/2020/06/08/why-floridas-toxic-algae-crisis-is-worse-than-people-realize/)
