title: "US flood risk"
description: |
  The US is getting flooded. A lot. [And the price for flood insurance is going up.](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/22/966428165/a-looming-disaster-new-data-reveal-where-flood-damage-is-an-existential-threat) Paradoxically, that may be a good thing. Flood insurances are subsidiced, and the price of the insurance is not based on the price of the house. In other words, rich folks benefit a lot from the subsidies. Just like those beautiful Miami beaches are always gonna be taken care of by the government. Also, it is just a terrible use of resources. Crappy houses are rebuilt again and again. And dams galore.
