title: "When you cannot actually push back"
description: |
  The fantastic Emily Atkin of Heated raised an interesting point regarding the premise of pushing back against the oil & gas industry. I thought it was just the oil & gas industry having the big money--and hence resources such as manpower--that you need to plaster every channel with your message. Turns out, it's more than that: [you may refused if you try to go through some of the same channels with your anti-fossil message](https://heated.world/p/we-arent-comfortable-running-that). That's just what happened to [polluters expsed](https://polluters.exposed/). Their campaign is very blunt--I assume it is assumed to have the feel of a political ad?--and some clips name and shame polluters directly. But then again, ads from the other side are very blunt, too. Doesn't surprise me that a gas station ad platform delivered the most blunt rejection--oil & gas ads are probably a considerable source of revenue for those guys.
