      "contents": "\n\n\n\n\nHow does learning relate to sustainability? One could argue that if\nan organization continually learns and improves processes and products,\nwe (humanity) could expect it to eventually become sustainable. Or one\ncould think of environmental pollution as a systemic problem and view\nindividual (organizational) action as necessarily insufficient or even\nmisleading. Quantitative data from the shows that the pipeline industry\non aggregate reduces the number and volume of spill over time. This\nreduction is not equivalent to an elimination of concerning\nenvironmental pollution. The literature provides two diverging positions\non this finding: (a) organizations engage in environmental management\nbecause they see the benefits of sustainable development. If enough\ncompanies were to jump on the bandwagon, their cumulative efforts could\nmitigate the environmental impacts of oil pipelines (or other\nindustries). Alternatively, based on trajectories, (b) system-wide\nemissions are and will in the foreseeable future remain at a level that\nthreatens vital ecosystems and resources such as essential aquifers.\nWithout more encompassing change at a meta-organizational level, we\ncannot reduce our environmental emission and pollution to a level that\nensures their conversation. The aggregated pipeline data offers a\npicture of significant aggregate improvements without an entire negation\nof potentially disastrous environmental impacts such as the Kalamazoo\nRiver oil spill. Any pipeline crossing an essential ecosystem or river\ncan not be assumed to be safe. Depending on one’s inclination, this\nobservation could be seen as aligning with either side (a) that\norganizational action can make a significant difference or (b) that a\nchange of the overall system needs to be initiated. More importantly,\nthe analysis has implications for specific ecosystems and pipelines, and\nsuggests a mode of research that should be applied to other industries\nand ecosystems.\n\n\n\n",
