      <title>Covid close and personal</title>
      <dc:creator>Julian Barg</dc:creator>
      <link>https://www.jbarg.net/posts/2021-03-08-covid-close-and-personal</link>
      <description>I think one reason for the American schism on covid is the lack of "human-interest stories" on covid, for the lack of a better term. I saw a lot of reports on the lockdown, people "suffering" from the mask mandate, etc. But relatively little on people suffering from covid, the doctors, nurses, etc. There is one new relevant documentary from the times accessible [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5BhuzqeDRU). It's probably not easy getting into a covid wing like that with your camera, so I appreciate the effort. And I also appreciate the perspective of what its like to battle covid in a less affluent community. Great stuff!</description>

      <title>Gulf stream</title>
      <dc:creator>Julian Barg</dc:creator>
      <link>https://www.jbarg.net/posts/2021-03-08-gulf-stream</link>
      <description>A weakening gulf stream has been a convern in Europe for a number of years, one that is not talked about a lot in American media. The gulf stream is what makes for such mild weather in Europe, so it's kind of a big deal. [Now we see new negative records.](https://www.livescience.com/gulf-stream-slowing-climate-change.html) That's more than a  bit concerning. Not only would it mean colder winters in Europe, but also more extreme weather on both sides of the Atlantic (think hurricane season).</description>

      <title>Sublime text on new machines</title>

      <link>https://www.jbarg.net/posts/2021-03-08-sublime-text-on-new-machines</link>
      <description>As you may know, I do have a bit of an obsession with IDEs, especially free and/or open source software. I have ignored sublime text for a couple of years but finally came around to it. And now I have finally discovered my favorite feature of it. To install packages in sublime--and the packages are really the killer feature--you first need to install thepackage manager. Turns out, [if you place the package manager file in the sublime folder, sublime will install the package manager automatically on startup.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19531651/8963109) And then you can also place a file with your installed packages in the settings folder, and sublime will install these for you too. Why this matters? It means you can set up a new machine with something like ansible, for instance installing sublime with apt, and then a simply get all your options with curl, and your machine is ready to go, but also has everything installed from scratch.</description>

      <title>German forest 'dying'</title>
      <dc:creator>Julian Barg</dc:creator>
      <link>https://www.jbarg.net/posts/2021-03-07-german-forest-dying</link>
      <description>That's probably a topic that most outside of Germany are not familiar with, but Germans really care about the forest. What forests don't like are high temperatures, droughts, and extreme weather. All of which we had plenty of in the recent past. So maybe its not all that surprising that the German forest is in a really bad shape. So bad that [German Spiegel writes that the German forest is "dying"](https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/wald-in-deutschland-noch-nie-sind-so-viele-baeume-gestorben-wie-2020-a-5233254c-b79e-4f8e-83c3-de50b2349ef4). Only 21% of trees have an undamaged crown, the lowest number ever recorded. A surprising cause of this decline: monoculture. Many of Germany's forests aren't all that natural. They have been created, e.g., to serve the early mining industry many centuries ago. And of course for that purpose (or whatever other purpose) you would only plant whatever kind of tree serves you best. So bark beetles are having a blast right now.</description>

      <description>[Great video at Climate Town last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmYvkCXXI4E). Texas experienced power outages, related to extreme weather. The power grid, all sorts of power plants, all struggling, but that is apparently not what Fox told its viewers--they blamed it on renewables. Anyways, the Texas blackout was an interesting episode of climate change. As a reminder: climate change means that our climate does not just become warmer on average, but the variance of our weather also increases. In this case, something about the [polar vortex having become unstable or "wobbly" and leaving its semi-permanent home, the arctic](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/texas-power-outage-underscores-looming-climate-tests/).

      <description>The US is getting flooded. A lot. [And the price for flood insurance is going up.](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/22/966428165/a-looming-disaster-new-data-reveal-where-flood-damage-is-an-existential-threat) Paradoxically, that may be a good thing. Flood insurances are subsidiced, and the price of the insurance is not based on the price of the house. In other words, rich folks benefit a lot from the subsidies. Just like those beautiful Miami beaches are always gonna be taken care of by the government. Also, it is just a terrible use of resources. Crappy houses are rebuilt again and again. And dams galore.</description>

      <description>[So it looks like Biden is planning to scrap Keystone XL on day one](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/17/biden-yank-keystone-pipeline-permit-460142). One the one hand obviously great news. On the other hand, it shows again what the whole ordeal had already proven so far. Whether or not a pipeline is constructed is not a process that is decided by scientific considerations. It depends mostly on political will. A funny side note is that TC Energy tried to preempt that move by announcing on Sunday that the pipeline would achieve net-zero emissions "across operations". Well, the emissions of **operating** a pipeline is not what we are concerned about...</description>

      <title>Flaws in legal theory</title>

      <description>[The tether story](https://www.jbarg.net/posts/2021-01-16-tether-defrauding-everybody/) reminded me a bit of Trump's legal strategy. The goal is not to win, but to gain more time. In the meantime, Trump could collect donations to "challenge the vote" (pay off campaign debts), or he could implement policy that--even if later reverted--could have a long-lasting impact. I think this strategy poses an enormous challenge to legal theory: justice will not be done if bad faith actors game the court system. Maybe in the end they lose a legal fight--in the meantim they have already "created facts". How does this relate to my work? The natural environment is truly the most vulnerable actor in this game. Who cares whether you lose the legal fight on the building permit if you have already built the pipeline? The damage to the natural environment cannot be undone.</description>

The announcement certainly marks a significant turn for the IEA. But it will probably not come as a surprise to those of you who have watched solar power mature. I think the trajectory was there for a number of years. I remember the resistance against renewable energy veiling itself in a dress of economics, but in retrospect it seems incredible how little forward looking that resistance was, even in economic terms.</description>

      <description>Today I was thinking to myself 'emission certificates on the EU ETS seem pretty cheap, we could just buy those in heaps to force the prices to go up'. So I did a little bit of digging around and found [the great _Compensators*_ project](https://www.compensators.org/en/compensate-2/) by the even more amazing _Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research_ (PIK). Their website makes it pretty easy to buy emission certificates, either by unit or by price, any fraction possible. At currently 41.52€, still a steal. Although I still remember prices being in the 20s. Well, prices going up is a good thing in this case I suppose.</description>

      <description>[The Heinrich Böll foundation makes the case for tackling climate change by our society adopting a different lifestyle, e.g., by relying less on cars, eating less meat, and traveling by train rather than plane.](https://konzeptwerk-neue-oekonomie.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A%20Societal%20Transformation%20Scenario.pdf) I believe that quality of life is determined more by how we spend our time and whether we create meaningful memories, rather than a high GDP, big cars, and big houses, so this report certainly strikes a nerve with me. The most important point though is certainly that we should not assume or hope that technological change will in the future make our current lifestyle more sustainable. I do not see the value in trying to preserve everything *as-is*.</description>

On the one hand, the video highlights some of the money flows to climate change denying think tanks.

This [...] explains more of the right's hostility to climate action than a naked story of enjoying checks being cut by the American Petroleum Institute" ([time stamp: 5:54](https://youtu.be/f1rxv1yPQrc?t=354)). For context, Jerry Taylor started his career about three decades ago at the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which today has gained infamy for [shopping around anti-protest legislation](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-louisiana-lawmakers-stop-residents-efforts-to-fight-big-oil-and-gas), [with great success](https://www.icnl.org/usprotestlawtracker/)!

In brief, they advocate for reproducible research on relevant issues, in service of society.</description>

      <title>Recycling</title>

      <description>If you haven't seen this [video](https://youtu.be/PJnJ8mK3Q3g) on the issues with recycling, you should probably watch it right now. In a similar vain, [this article](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/11/897692090/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled) by NPR on the topic. In short, the plastics industry created an identifier logo for different plastics that looks very similar to the public domain recycling logo, and then lobbied for legislation to make that logo mandatory on all public products. The result: the public beliefs that our plastics are recycled, when really only 10% of them are (at least in the US).</description>

      <description>I was looking around for practical experiments that demonstrate global warming, and found [this wonderful short experiment by NASA](https://web.archive.org/web/20161118141122/https://glory.gsfc.nasa.gov/globalwarmingexperiment.html).</description>

      <title>Ontology</title>

      <description>If you are like me, or everybody I know, you mix up ontology and epistemology on a regular basis. Well, legendary Aussie psychadelic rock band King Gizzard and the Lizzard Wizzard decided to chima in and write a song about [Ontology](https://youtu.be/D5q5OEho8II). So you can listen to that and still not understand what ontology is about, isn't that great?</description>

      <title>A new school of environmental economics?</title>
      <dc:creator>Julian Barg</dc:creator>
      <link>https://www.jbarg.net/posts/2020-12-17-new-school-of-environmental-economics</link>
      <description>Not entirely by chance did I come across this interesting discourse in economics about gas emissions. @Shapiro2018a have disaggregated CO, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, PM10, PM2.5, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, VOCs, and CO&lt;sub2&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; emission in the US from 1990-2008 by industry, location, facility, and product. They find that during that time period, emission reductions are driven not by technological change or trade, but by more stringent regulations. The cost of complying with these regulations in 2008 amounted to an implicit pollution tax equal to ~1.1% of total production cost--double the value in the year 1990. (cont.)</description>

      <title>Using new software</title>
      <dc:creator>Julian Barg</dc:creator>
      <link>https://www.jbarg.net/posts/2020-12-15-using-new-software</link>
      <description>The last couple of days I have started experimenting with distill, and began integrating it into my workflow--this blog is a result of that effort. The problem with using new software is that a lot of the features I desire are not there yet. In this case, I got a little bit too impatient maybe and went on github to report issues, and make feature requests. Since resources are limited, a lot of my reports have not been picked up yet, but one was. Being an early adapter is always a challenge, and reporting issues is part of that. On the one hand, I don't want to ask too much from open source developers. On the other hand, feedback from early adapters is what open source developers need in order to know in what direction to go. So it's some neat feedback for me to see that one of my reported issues became part of the (milestone 1.2 for R distill)[https://github.com/rstudio/distill/milestone/2]. I hope as a user I am contributing by reporting issues, and not just being a pain for the developers.</description>

      <title>Fierce resistance cannot prevent pipeline project</title>
      <dc:creator>Julian Barg</dc:creator>
      <link>https://www.jbarg.net/posts/2020-12-14-fierce-resistance-cannot-prevent-pipeline-project</link>
      <description>[Interesting report in the Boston Globe about the construction of a compressor station](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/12/12/metro/was-it-ever-fair-fight/). Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker was determined to approve the project, it seems. This story raises the question of what factors determine whether a pipeline project is approved. Since their 1999 policy revision, [FERC has approved 400 applications for pipeline projects, and has rejected only 2](https://www.analysisgroup.com/uploadedfiles/content/insights/publishing/ag_ferc_natural_gas_pipeline_certification.pdf). There are public input opportunities built into the certification process, but in practice these only serve to "inform" the public of a decision that has already been made.</description>

      <title>Vaccine logistics</title>

      <description>Why do countries need logistics partners to distribute the new vaccines? [Bloomberg has a pretty cool infographic](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-uk-vaccine-logistics/). Shipping a few vials is fine, shipping literally millions is going to be quite the challenge.</description>
