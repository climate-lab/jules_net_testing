The statement was drawn up by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). And with regard to climate impact, the findings are an astute \"we don't know\". I'm not sure why I am so surprised, I did know already that there is no reliable way of calculating that. Even @Erickson2014 encompasses a wide range of potential impacts. I guess it's probably just surprising to see it spelled out like that by FERC, and it sounds so resigned.\n\n(Continue reading.)",

    "contents": "\n\nTo date, staff have not identified a methodology to attribute discrete, quantifiable, physical effects on the environment to the Project’s incremental contribution to GHGs. We have looked at atmospheric modeling used by the USEPA, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and others, and we found that these models are not reasonable for Project-level analysis for a number of reasons. For example, these global models are not suited to determine the incremental impact of individual projects, due to both scale and overwhelming complexity. We also reviewed simpler models and mathematical techniques to determine global physical effects caused by GHG emissions, such as increases in global atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, atmospheric forcing, or ocean CO2 absorption. We could not identify a reliable, less complex model for this task and thus staff could not determine specific localized or regional physical impacts from GHG emissions from the Project. Without the ability to determine discrete resource impacts, Commission staff are unable to assess the Project’s contribution to climate change through any objective analysis of physical impact attributable to the Project.\n(ibid. p. 11f)\n\nAlmost everything I have looked at with regard to pipelines and oil spills screams “we don’t know.” And whenever there was a “known known,” chances were it would be revised later. Maybe we should say “we don’t know” more often. Of course the question is know–what does this imply for FERC’s decision on the pipeline? Something tells me that the pipeline will be permitted anyways. Maybe we will hear something like “it’s not the operator’s fault we don’t know–we shouldn’t punish the operator?”\nEIS statement is available here.\n\n\n\nErickson, Peter, and Michael Lazarus. 2014. “Impact of the Keystone XL Pipeline on Global Oil Markets and Greenhouse Gas Emissions.” Nature Climate Change 4 (9): 778–81. https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2335.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nAOM ONE is holding a plenary session under slogan “From Problems to Solutions.” I wanted to put down my thoughts on this. My first reaction is–based on where we are, I don’t think that direction is one that we can take? I think we are squarely in a “solution” period, problematization is missing in action. I also see a parallel to sustainable development vs. ecocentrism and similar subsequent debates (Gladwin, Kennelly, and Krause 1995; Ergene, Banerjee, and Hoffman 2020). One side jumps to the conclusion and presents a solution, implicitly assuming that a solution must be feasible. The other side seeks a focus on the environmental problems, usually with much less focus on the problems. These particularly stood out to me because another colleague recently said to me “if somebody comes to me with a solution, I am going to reject that article. I want to focus on problems.”\nI think it is a hard pill for some to swallow that a solution might not exist. Not because we are missing the technology or know-how, but because of the social system behind the problem. Ironically, to frame the situation as hopeless and to focus on problems might be the only way to give a social impetus for change. The sustainable development crowd might be missing the mark when it inspires hope, because that festers compartmentalization and complacency. But the belief behind it seems to be rather than complex analysis, the belief that “if we frame the situation as hopeless, people are going to feel disparaged, they are not going to act.” In my experience, the opposite is true. Those who seem the most cornered are the most avid fighters. Might just be an example of our model of the world at work, shaping our research. By the way, all this is not to say that we should orient ourselves back toward ecocentrism, I think we have moved past that.\n\n\n\nErgene, Seray, Subhabrata Bobby Banerjee, and Andrew J.

    "contents": "\nHere is the connection between discourse and legitimacy in brief. In the literature, it is a two step process. Research on institutions drives inquiry into discourse (Leibel, Hallett, and Bechky 2018). And within that literature, legitimacy takes an important or central importance in many of the works. Conversely, discourse analysis is one of the three methods mainly used in research on legitimacy (Suddaby, Bitektine, and Haack 2017). What does legitimacy mean to those authors? Where legitimacy is used, it constitutes or “replaces” the institution. When legitimacy is achieved, the institution is intact. When legitimacy is lost, the institution ceases to exist. Guérard, Bode, and Gustafsson (2013) is the clearest about this: “Before a social movement reaches moral legitimacy, it is unlikely that frame transformation will be effective because actors may perceive the movement as marginal […]” (p. 809).\nThe lack of detail on the mechanism here is a shame. Guérard, Bode, and Gustafsson (2013) features an unusually rich description of the dyadic interaction (which they call dualistic) of two actors: the German car industry, and various environmental organizations in conjunction with other nonprofits. The article’s use of the term “legitimacy” indicates that there are other relevant actors. Specifically, their findings indicates that there are one or two actors of importance. The government considers taking action, but decision makers get their cues from (perceived) public support. Legitimacy is of course a theoretical construct, and part of a model that aims to allow for a easier representation of the reality–which includes shaving off details. But Guérard, Bode, and Gustafsson (2013) also indicate that the government is a somewhat complex actor with its own networks and contingencies: one of the central claims that they make concerns the power that the car industry has over the government. This connection–the connection that constitutes power–is not further explicated on the basis of their qualitative data.\nThe further developments in the empirical context after they publish their article highlights that it matters who “provides” an institution with legitimacy. The emission scandal after the end of their observation scandal, which hit Volkswagen the strongest, shows that legitimacy alone was not enough to enforce a new technology, and government oversight fell short of what it should be–probably because of the power relations that the authors raise without detailing them. The dyadic relationship between the car industry and the government–let alone the public–is at least as complex as that between the car industry and activists. Other examples of the construct legitimacy being used to abridge a context–albeit to a lesser extend–include the work of Rao, Monin, and Durand (2003), Zilber (2007), and Ansari, Wijen, and Gray (2013), which otherwise is more or less faithful to the discourse taking place.\nIn contrast, consider the legitimacy-as-perception view raised by Suddaby, Bitektine, and Haack (2017). Located at the center of the approach is the idea that legitimacy lies in the eye of the beholder, be it an individual or collectives. In that view, it matters who attributes legitimacy to an institution. The question of audiences is widely discussed. For instance, an individual might hold a negative view of an industry sector, but still take this industry for granted–in that case, the institution is still intact. Specifically, that occurs when the individual is aware that her view diverges from the majority opinion. Vergne (2012) elaborates this point by differentiating legitimacy and stigma.\nThe concept of legitimacy as used by Guérard, Bode, and Gustafsson (2013) and others in the discourse literature embodies the tautology that is at the very heart of institutional theory. An institution exists if when something is institutionalized. When something is legitimized, then it becomes legitimate. To differentiate audiences is one first step toward clearing up the tautology. We can see the workings of the taken-for-grantedness when we understand who takes what for granted. Even better when that audience then becomes alive as an actor. The passive audience is a rare phenomenon: when an actor or institution acts on an audience–i.e., manipulates it (Oliver 1992)–there is bound to be a reaction.\nTo show the workings of this process, we do not need the legitimacy concept. We can achieve the same by showing who the audience is, and how this audience interacts with the institution. Legitimacy then is a useful metaphor to summarize the process, but it should not be used as more than a metaphor for something that is explicated elsewhere, unless legitimacy is a sideshow to the research. The empirical research on discourse and institutions meanwhile suggests that the audience is much less of a passive participant than frequently implied. It matters who beliefs what (to be legitimacy) because the audience does get involved. And even more than that, e.g., in contexts such as the American oil and gas industry, the line between audience, actor, and institution can at times be a very blurry one.\n\n\n\nAnsari, Shahzad (Shaz), Frank Wijen, and Barbara Gray. 2013. “Constructing a Climate Change Logic: An Institutional Perspective on the ‘Tragedy of the Commons’.” Organization Science 24 (4): 1014–40. https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1120.0799.\n\n\nGuérard, Stéphane, Christoph Bode, and Robin Gustafsson. 2013. “Turning Point Mechanisms in a Dualistic Process Model of Institutional Emergence: The Case of the Diesel Particulate Filter in Germany.” Organization Studies 34 (5-6): 781–822. https://doi.org/10.1177/0170840613479237.\n\n\nLeibel, Esther, Tim Hallett, and Beth A.

The bigger picture: [The Nothern hemisphere is sectored into alterning heat domes and areas of lower pressure](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/07/20/heat-wave-northern-hemisphere/). The jet stream over the Northern Hemisphere is basically experiencing a traffic jam. The human costs are enormous. In some countries, problems are worsened by social policy. [For example, 3%  of the population of Portland is homeless!](https://grist.org/cities/portland-heat-wave-homeless-support/) Can you imagine? I like to think that Europe has a much smaller homeless population than America. But then again, in the further North you go, the less houses have air conditioning--things are not going well.\n\nI think about this as the _actual new normal_. Natural disasters are becoming more frequent, _that_ is the actual cost of climate change. Sure, we can clean up after one Hurrican Katrina. And California's economy somehow survived the 2011-2017 drought (more like 2011-2021 drought with temporary relief...). Are we going to start really struggling in a few years, when these events become a regular occurance? Wikipedia already has articles on the 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2018, and 2021 heat waves. When do these heat waves just become weather?\n\nIt is easy to overlook that places like Pakistan, South Africa, and Bangladesh are already struggling because of a double whammy of climate and policy failure. What other countries are going to be added to the list before the end of the decade?",

    "contents": "\nJust read Leibel, Hallett, and Bechky (2018). I few things stand out to me. First, how few papers there are in the area. They review 61 articles, including papers on discourse, rhetorics, and frames. Then, how little the literature concerns itself with dialogue and interaction–as opposed to statements that are issued and read by allies only. The insular nature of society media is reflected in our research. There is a lack of dyadic relationships, or, for the lack of a better word, networks. Not in a quantitative network analysis kind of way–that may in most cases just reinforce insularity–but in a very simple “who says what to whom, and what happens then” way. That is how insularity comes to be. How is it that the few times where A says something to X rather than B and C–A being similar to B and C but not X–it is so easy for X to dismiss that message? In a similar vain, the dearth of qualitative work in the area after the linguistic turn we supposedly have taken. Sure, quantifying discourse language is convenient, but on many of the big, important issues, the fronts are quite clear. For instance, interest groups such as indigenous people say what they think, with much clarity. There is no need to code the language just to decode it again. I don’t think the supposed hidden messages exist–the only thing that may be hidden away is part of the discourse, and it takes a good researcher to surface relevant documents (I know this conflicts with the previous sentence, leave me alone!).\nI do suspect though that there is some additional, older research–especially mixed methods with archival work and interviews–that could be interpreted as being concerned with discourse, but which lacks the clear methods section to make the link.\n\n\n\nLeibel, Esther, Tim Hallett, and Beth A.

An institution exists when it is enacted by actors through social action. It ceases to exist when it stops being enacted by actors. That observation seems not to be very profound.

PFAS, or \"forever chemicals\" are a group of substances that is associated with numerous superfund sites in the US, many of them related to manufacturing sites that were operated by the military. I swear I read an excellent lengthy news report about one of those sites before which laid out in detail the suffering of the current residents--most of them minorities (of course...). Cannot find it anymore unfortunately, but it seems there are many stories out there. [Turns out, some fracking chemicals form PFAS as a side product.|https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/climate/epa-pfas-fracking-forever-chemicals.html] That's not where the story gets interesting though. The interesting part is that the EPA knew since 2011, but failed to follow up. And that this issue has been revealed through a FOIA request by Physicians for Social Responsibility. The group does a great job at unveiling concerning developments, in an investigative journalism fashion. The takeaway is something I had in my mind for a longer time. (1) The EPA is not (always) on your side. (2) FOIAs are THE most important tool in our toolbox to shape discourse toward protecting humans and the environment. And (3) to make a positive impact requires an enormous amount of resources and patience. Many agencies fight tooth and nail to prevent a release of information. To obtain information, one frequently needs to follow up with the court, and be willing to go all the way to the Supreme Court. Only an organization that has significant financial resources and personnel continuity can succeed in pursuing an issue like that. And the number of organizations like that in the US can probably be counted on ~10 hands? I think that's why its so easy for relevant information to go unnoticed, and for corporations to get away with polluting for extended periods of time.",

But I am getting distracted. What stood out to me was that out of all those pipeline operators, TransCanada is the one that will not allow the farmer to move heavy equipment over the line. Which is a problem if you are a farmer and the line runs 2 miles across your property. So maybe some of the challenges that TransCanada encountered do stem from the fact that they are lacking experience in the US and made some enemies with their behavior?",

This highlights an interesting dimension that Keystone XL will take in the future. It is not over, yet. It also highlights the role that states such as Montana take. Maybe the default position would be to believe that states are arbitrators in the process, checkin the merits of a project before approving it. The reality is probably that individual decision makers--not in all cases, but often enough--act as active cheerleaders for projects such as Keystone XL.",

Meanwhile, the land has been owned by The Nature Conservacy all along.

Of course the fact that the rules of carbon accounting allow for that in the first place is concerning. Looking at you, American Carbon Registry.",

This is the Extinction Rebellion playbook. Oil & gas might seem mighty, but there are some bottlenecks, if you are reckless enough to target them. Network analysis 101. Sometimes those vulnerabilities are physical, and can be targeted through blockades. But in this case, the inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage might threaten pipeline projects, specifically the Trans Mountain pipeline. And it seems activists needed relatively little manpower to achieve partial victories. If TMX can be defeated by activists, one could argue that a small number of self-appointed environmental leaders have done more for the climate than Trudeau? That would be a remarkable feat.",

Cause they have such a great track record on developing technology. They built like 10 wind turbines and a solar park somewhere, I'm sure. To use in an ad, and abandon the year after. I am not even exaggerating--[renewables made up for 0.8% of capital investments of oil firms in 2019, despite being a popular theme in ads of ExxonMobil, BP, and the likes](https://earthrights.org/blog/big-oil-dumps-billions-into-misleading-advertising-campaigns/).\n\nAn interesting offshoot of that thouht is wheter technology isn't more valuable for the oil and gas industry in its current shape of being the perpetual future. Think about it: now that its still the technology of the future, the theme can be used to raise funds, and oil companies can point at it and say \"oil and gas is fine!\" That is a much more comfy situation compared to building carbon capture and storage sites and discovering that it is not that simple, or cheap, or reliable in keeping the carbon in. So if anything, the industry should try to stay in this state a little longer, where technology is still a thing of the future with potential, rather than a reality with flaws.",

    "description": "[So Biden allows the Dakota Access Pipeline to keep operatings, despite it having no Environmental Impact Statement](https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/article/14202049). I am not too surprised. Why should you still care? One of the most intriguing thing about studying pipelines is this: the construction of pipelines as our mode of shaping the world. In German there is a term for that: \"Fakten schaffen\"--\"creating facts\". Implying that while your counterpart still contemplates about what action to take--or even before that stage, you take action, do something, anything. The intent being that by just by acting first, you get to decide, you get to take your preferred action. A fitting example would be buying an expensive car before consulting your husband or wife. Nothing you can do about it now, the contract is already signed! \n\nIn 2017, the Trump administration waived the need for a full environmental review for the Dakota Access Pipeline. Energy Transfer Partners managed to build the pipeline within Trump's tenure. The story that follows is pretty convoluted, [a court ordered the pipeline to be shut down while the environmental review is completed](https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/article/14180097), [another court overturned that order before it went into effect](https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/government/article/14179644), and the Biden administration now confirmed that DAPL can keep operating. What I am getting at is that academia is speding a whole lot of time contemplating things while the world keeps moving. While we study the environmental effects on one ecosystem, two more have already fallen victim. I think there is a lot of merit to analyzing the world as a burst of decisions that flow from our social structure, rather than contemplating about the ins and outs of individual decisions.",

I did not realize that not only did Trump rubberstamp Keystone XL (which was later undone by Biden), but he also kneekapped the environmental reviews for pipelines in general. Not sure whether that was later undone by Biden. [To do so he relied on a trick that the Republicans already attempted in Congress when Obama was still president--although Obama called their bluff](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/us/state-dept-to-put-oil-pipeline-on-hold.html). The rule he introduced states that the Department of State has 60 days after an application is received to collect information on the basis of which the president then makes a decision. Since not a lot of information can be collected in 60 days, this makes it easier for the president to rubberstamp such applications. As a side note, Obama's response back in the days was to deny the application, stating that not enough information could be collected to confidentially determine whether the project is in the national interest.",

Obviously, as always, I am focusing on environmental pollution. The second broad area is that of decision making, and the illusion of rationality. But right now, with my work on pipelines, it is much simpler. While reading the [testimony of former TransCanada employee and whistleblower Evan Vokes](https://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/news/200/former-transcanada-engineer-warning-to-residents-south-of-the-border-dont-trust-transcanada/) (what a name, eh?), I realized how much there is actually on the record on social action leading up to big, collective decision making, and how much of it I have seen or read in the past, particularly with regard to the oil & gas industry. And that is the kind of stuff that should be on record in the academic literature. We do not have to guess as to the underlying reasons of corporate action & communication. We certainly should not *always* hesitate to speculate about their intentions, and assume some kind of rational optimization at the aggregate level. At the surface, the discourse seems oriented toward environmental safety, but it really does not need a lot of scratching to reveal a lot more complexity.",

Sure, the US will never date nationalize your company or put any significant tax on your riches--but they will take it for the benefit of corporate profits. What great progress. The usual modus operandi for the construction of pipelines, as with many public works in the US, poses a justice issue: like with highways in the mid-century, property value are a factor for deciding where to build pipelines. Guess which neighborhoods are usually poorer and have their propert value assessed at a lower level? So African-Americans, who are already disadvantaged, have a harder time building up any wealth because if they buy real estate at lower value in an African-American neighborhood do not get the same returns on their investments that the European immigrants get. Chances are, they will even lose a significant share of their money.

The implication is that \"it's a dirty job and somebody has got to do it.\" \"It ain't pretty, but we need it.\" Do we though?

It should be (1) FOSS, (2) actively being developed, (3) available on Windows, macOS, Linux, (5) able to import text documents, PDFs, and ideally html files, (6) capable of importing highlights and notes from PDFs, (7) save its data in a convenient form, for instance as an SQL database. But it seems outside of Atlas Ti and NVivo there isn't much going on.\n\nRQDA is really janky, but at least it saves its data as an SQLite database. QDAP only works with text data. Cassandre's website looks... sketchy... Of course Atlas Ti uses SPSS under the hood, which only makes sense if you are being developed by the same software (just a guess, I don't actually know). And it cannot import websites, only if you have already saved them to PDF. And NVivo straight up doesn't have a Linux client (you could probably run it in wine, but that's not the pont) AND requires NVivo to be installed on your system for you to be able to launch its browser version. What a dumpster fire. \n\nSo the way I see it, you can do two things. Either organize your material yourself, but I think getting all the crossreferences into a discourse would not be feasible without taking way too much effort. Or you can think short term and run a project on Atlas Ti. I am sure they won't be at the top of the pack in ten years, so that's a pity. Won't be able to migrate your data out, either. I am now trying to organize as much as possible outside of software, before importing stuff as the last step. But the fact that you cannot even import the annotations that are already saved to a PDF document--so annoying.",

A total of 442 barrels was spilled, and some had run off the facility by the time the spill was discovered. The spill was caused by a corroded pipe. Fortunately, the station was shut down at the time of the incident, or a lot more crude oil might have leaked. For more information, see PHMSA report number 20200166.",

    "description": "[A water warrior claiming to be harassed by Minnesota police on behalf of Enbridge](https://heated.world/p/i-dont-feel-safe-here). Police officers trailing activists en route to protests for hours and billing Enbridge for the time. The original intention of the law that this is based on might have been to shift costs from the state to Embridge. The interesting question is whether Enbridge told the police to go all-out or whether police offices took the initiative and what we observe is a revenue-generating strategy by the police forces. My sense is that it did not require much communication for this situation to occur if Enbridge and the police are on the same page on this issue anyways. Another aspect: the first example in the text is a woman getting fined for failing to signal more than 100 feet before a turn. That police strategy we have all seen before: pull over a member of a group that you don't like--if you know the law well enough you will always be able to fine that individual for some obscure infraction. There are also lots of instances of use of excessive force of male police officers against female activists.",

Well, guess what is also in Texas. Most of America's chemical industry. Because it is an attractive place for the chemical industry to be, where you can have your [chemical plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Fertilizer_Company_explosion) [blow](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/27/783263942/massive-explosion-rips-through-texas-chemical-plant) [up](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/hurricane-harvey/harvey-danger-how-toxic-air-texas-chemical-plant-explosion-n797876) [without](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chemicals-fire-tpc-portneches-idUSKBN1Y80HH) [significant](https://www.cnn.com/2014/04/22/us/west-texas-fertilizer-plant-explosion-investigation) [repercussions](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/03/30/arkema-disaster-harvey-regulations-texas-crosby/). The EPA there is a toothless tiger: it will help you clean up and communicate with the public that they are safe, but they do not actually have the resources--or legislation--in place to prosecute the perpetrators.\n\nThe problem with having the chemical industry concentrated there is that the world is facing a [shortage](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/polar-storm-paralyses-us-gulf-coast-petrochemical-sector/4013306.article) in [certain plastics](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/polar-storm-paralyses-us-gulf-coast-petrochemical-sector/4013306.article). Not that I am a fan of plastics in the first place, but I do appreciate the irony. Lax regulations have led to the location of much of the chemical industry in Texas, a weak preparation of said plants for disasters, and to the devastating blackouts.

I saw a lot of reports on the lockdown, people \"suffering\" from the mask mandate, etc. But relatively little on people suffering from covid, the doctors, nurses, etc. There is one new relevant documentary from the times accessible [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5BhuzqeDRU). It's probably not easy getting into a covid wing like that with your camera, so I appreciate the effort. And I also appreciate the perspective of what its like to battle covid in a less affluent community. Great stuff!\n\n**Edit**: I forgot to mention, I am somewhat sure that one reason for the dearth of more personal covid content is Youtube's restrictive policy. I remember at least a handfull of creators mentioning that merely saying the c-word can lead to their video being demonitized. I understand that the policy was put in place to tackle desinformation, but it would be interesting to see in how far it has also done a bit of the opposite. My intuitition is that a nurse or patient suffering from covid would go either to youtube or to twitter to document their fate or make a plea to others. Now the only way to get on youtube and reach a sizable audience is to have an official news team by your side. Of course there is also the fact that many of the sickest cannot talk or comment on their fate at all.",

Only 21% of trees have an undamaged crown, the lowest number ever recorded. A surprising cause of this decline: monoculture. Many of Germany's forests aren't all that natural. They have been created, e.g., to serve the early mining industry many centuries ago. And of course for that purpose (or whatever other purpose) you would only plant whatever kind of tree serves you best. So bark beetles are having a blast right now.",

The fact that Texas could not import electricity is the result of Texas seceding from the national power grid with the aim of evading federal rules– to “deregulate”. That’s probably also why state regulations do not require operators to prepare for extreme weather. The system does apparently also include a sizable share of renewable energy (at least for American standards), but of course wind turbines were not winterized, just like the rest of the system. Texas previously experienced a similar weather-related outage in 2011 and I suspect since Tucker Carlson somehow managed to blame everything on renewables, nobody will feel compelled to make any changes and we will see similar outages again in the future.\n\n\n\n",

Sovereignty as the highest priority. Higher than anything else. \"The process just wasn’t driven by thinking about what the UK really wanted from a deal, but to justify the claims to sovereignty. It was quite astonishing\" says one government official. (cont.)",

    "contents": "\nThe process strikes me as interesting because of course sovereignty is an abstract concept, and what he gave away–access to Europe’s finance markets, free movement of goods and personnel, the ability to sell fresh British goods on continental European markets–are all tangible benefits. It made me realize how much I expected the UK to act on tangible interests, not ideals–though it has to be noted that these were shitty ideals in the first place, sovereignty is still an ideal. Of course the trick to doing that is not to collect any data that would put the sanity of your plan into question.\nTwo quotes stand out: “According to government officials, successive chancellors Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak stopped officials carrying out a new analysis of the proposed deal, which would have come to the awkward conclusion that Britain would be left worse off.” And: “Three people actively involved in lobbying government on behalf of industry told the Financial Times that chief executives who confronted ministers too overtly found that they were dropped off future conference calls.”\nAnd then of course there is the poison pill: the freedom clause that Boris Johnson had introduced last minute. Which the EU promptly threatened to trigger this week with regard to Covid vaccine exports. Hilarious! The EU has walked back on that threat yesterday\n\n\n\n",

Whether or not a pipeline is constructed is not a process that is decided by scientific considerations. It depends mostly on political will. A funny side note is that TC Energy tried to preempt that move by announcing on Sunday that the pipeline would achieve net-zero emissions \"across operations\".

In the meantime, Trump could collect donations to \"challenge the vote\" (pay off campaign debts), or he could implement policy that--even if later reverted--could have a long-lasting impact. I think this strategy poses an enormous challenge to legal theory: justice will not be done if bad faith actors game the court system. Maybe in the end they lose a legal fight--in the meantim they have already \"created facts\". How does this relate to my work? The natural environment is truly the most vulnerable actor in this game. Who cares whether you lose the legal fight on the building permit if you have already built the pipeline? The damage to the natural environment cannot be undone.",

Energy security is not a concern at all anymore today, thanks to the fact that solar energy is the cheapest source of energy in history https://www.jbarg.net/posts/2021-01-10-solar-cheapest-electricity-in-history/–that has made energy a buyer’s market! In terms of technology, we are pretty damn close to living in a utopia. So the fact that we are not widely applying that technology, but instead pushing back against it (at least in North America) is even more dramatic than I thought before.\n\n\n\n",

(1) Keiser and Shapiro (2019) finds that cost of clean water legislation amounts to ~0.8% of GDP per year, but that these legislations have effectively improved water quality in the US. They also criticize the lack of research on water pollution in the economics literature. (2) Isen, Rossin-Slater, and Walker (2017) determine through a quasi-experiment (regression discontinuity) that lower levels of air pollution in the early childhood improve labor market performance in adults. (3) Deschênes, Greenstone, and Shapiro (2017) uses an instrumental variable design. Some counties have no power plants which emit NOX–and hence exhibit no NOX pollution in summer. They find that reducing NOX emissions by one million tons per year will save about $0.5 billion in medication expenditures, and prevent 3,100 premature summertime deaths (which economists value at $2.1 billion…). (4) Fabra and Reguant (2014) finds that power companies fully pass through the cost associated cap-and-trade programs to consumers via electricity prices in the absence of proper market design. All of these works are impressive and change the way we think about pollution.

The problem with using new software is that a lot of the features I desire are not there yet. In this case, I got a little bit too impatient maybe and went on github to report issues, and make feature requests. Since resources are limited, a lot of my reports have not been picked up yet, but one was. Being an early adapter is always a challenge, and reporting issues is part of that. On the one hand, I don't want to ask too much from open source developers. On the other hand, feedback from early adapters is what open source developers need in order to know in what direction to go. So it's some neat feedback for me to see that one of my reported issues became part of the (milestone 1.2 for R distill)[https://github.com/rstudio/distill/milestone/2]. I hope as a user I am contributing by reporting issues, and not just being a pain for the developers.",

    "description": "[Interesting report in the Boston Globe about the construction of a compressor station](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/12/12/metro/was-it-ever-fair-fight/). Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker was determined to approve the project, it seems. This story raises the question of what factors determine whether a pipeline project is approved. Since their 1999 policy revision, [FERC has approved 400 applications for pipeline projects, and has rejected only 2](https://www.analysisgroup.com/uploadedfiles/content/insights/publishing/ag_ferc_natural_gas_pipeline_certification.pdf). There are public input opportunities built into the certification process, but in practice these only serve to \"inform\" the public of a decision that has already been made.",
