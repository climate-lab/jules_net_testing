    "description": "[A water warrior claiming to be harassed by Minnesota police on behalf of Enbridge](https://heated.world/p/i-dont-feel-safe-here). Police officers trailing activists en route to protests for hours and billing Enbridge for the time. The original intention of the law that this is based on might have been to shift costs from the state to Embridge. The interesting question is whether Enbridge told the police to go all-out or whether police offices took the initiative and what we observe is a revenue-generating strategy by the police forces. My sense is that it did not require much communication for this situation to occur if Enbridge and the police are on the same page on this issue anyways. Another aspect: the first example in the text is a woman getting fined for failing to signal more than 100 feet before a turn. That police strategy we have all seen before: pull over a member of a group that you don't like--if you know the law well enough you will always be able to fine that individual for some obscure infraction. There are also lots of instances of use of excessive force of male police officers against female activists.",

Well, guess what is also in Texas. Most of America's chemical industry. Because it is an attractive place for the chemical industry to be, where you can have your [chemical plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Fertilizer_Company_explosion) [blow](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/27/783263942/massive-explosion-rips-through-texas-chemical-plant) [up](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/hurricane-harvey/harvey-danger-how-toxic-air-texas-chemical-plant-explosion-n797876) [without](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chemicals-fire-tpc-portneches-idUSKBN1Y80HH) [significant](https://www.cnn.com/2014/04/22/us/west-texas-fertilizer-plant-explosion-investigation) [repercussions](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/03/30/arkema-disaster-harvey-regulations-texas-crosby/). The EPA there is a toothless tiger: it will help you clean up and communicate with the public that they are safe, but they do not actually have the resources--or legislation--in place to prosecute the perpetrators.\n\nThe problem with having the chemical industry concentrated there is that the world is facing a [shortage](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/polar-storm-paralyses-us-gulf-coast-petrochemical-sector/4013306.article) in [certain plastics](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/polar-storm-paralyses-us-gulf-coast-petrochemical-sector/4013306.article). Not that I am a fan of plastics in the first place, but I do appreciate the irony. Lax regulations have led to the location of much of the chemical industry in Texas, a weak preparation of said plants for disasters, and to the devastating blackouts.

I saw a lot of reports on the lockdown, people \"suffering\" from the mask mandate, etc. But relatively little on people suffering from covid, the doctors, nurses, etc. There is one new relevant documentary from the times accessible [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5BhuzqeDRU). It's probably not easy getting into a covid wing like that with your camera, so I appreciate the effort. And I also appreciate the perspective of what its like to battle covid in a less affluent community. Great stuff!\n\n**Edit**: I forgot to mention, I am somewhat sure that one reason for the dearth of more personal covid content is Youtube's restrictive policy. I remember at least a handfull of creators mentioning that merely saying the c-word can lead to their video being demonitized. I understand that the policy was put in place to tackle desinformation, but it would be interesting to see in how far it has also done a bit of the opposite. My intuitition is that a nurse or patient suffering from covid would go either to youtube or to twitter to document their fate or make a plea to others. Now the only way to get on youtube and reach a sizable audience is to have an official news team by your side. Of course there is also the fact that many of the sickest cannot talk or comment on their fate at all.",

Only 21% of trees have an undamaged crown, the lowest number ever recorded. A surprising cause of this decline: monoculture. Many of Germany's forests aren't all that natural. They have been created, e.g., to serve the early mining industry many centuries ago. And of course for that purpose (or whatever other purpose) you would only plant whatever kind of tree serves you best. So bark beetles are having a blast right now.",

The fact that Texas could not import electricity is the result of Texas seceding from the national power grid with the aim of evading federal rules– to “deregulate”. That’s probably also why state regulations do not require operators to prepare for extreme weather. The system does apparently also include a sizable share of renewable energy (at least for American standards), but of course wind turbines were not winterized, just like the rest of the system. Texas previously experienced a similar weather-related outage in 2011 and I suspect since Tucker Carlson somehow managed to blame everything on renewables, nobody will feel compelled to make any changes and we will see similar outages again in the future.\n\n\n\n",

Of course the trick to doing that is not to collect any data that would put the sanity of your plan into question.\nTwo quotes stand out: “According to government officials, successive chancellors Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak stopped officials carrying out a new analysis of the proposed deal, which would have come to the awkward conclusion that Britain would be left worse off.” And: “Three people actively involved in lobbying government on behalf of industry told the Financial Times that chief executives who confronted ministers too overtly found that they were dropped off future conference calls.”\nAnd then of course there is the poison pill: the freedom clause that Boris Johnson had introduced last minute. Which the EU promptly threatened to trigger this week with regard to Covid vaccine exports. Hilarious! The EU has walked back on that threat yesterday\n\n\n\n",

Whether or not a pipeline is constructed is not a process that is decided by scientific considerations. It depends mostly on political will. A funny side note is that TC Energy tried to preempt that move by announcing on Sunday that the pipeline would achieve net-zero emissions \"across operations\". Well, the emissions of **operating** a pipeline is not what we are concerned about...",

In the meantime, Trump could collect donations to \"challenge the vote\" (pay off campaign debts), or he could implement policy that--even if later reverted--could have a long-lasting impact. I think this strategy poses an enormous challenge to legal theory: justice will not be done if bad faith actors game the court system. Maybe in the end they lose a legal fight--in the meantim they have already \"created facts\". How does this relate to my work? The natural environment is truly the most vulnerable actor in this game. Who cares whether you lose the legal fight on the building permit if you have already built the pipeline? The damage to the natural environment cannot be undone.",

Energy security is not a concern at all anymore today, thanks to the fact that solar energy is the cheapest source of energy in history https://www.jbarg.net/posts/2021-01-10-solar-cheapest-electricity-in-history/–that has made energy a buyer’s market!

So the fact that we are not widely applying that technology, but instead pushing back against it (at least in North America) is even more dramatic than I thought before.\n\n\n\n",

Shapiro and Walker (2018) have disaggregated CO, NO2, PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NOx, VOCs, and CO emission in the US from 1990-2008 by industry, location, facility, and product. They find that during that time period, emission reductions are driven not by technological change or trade, but by more stringent regulations.

(1) Keiser and Shapiro (2019) finds that cost of clean water legislation amounts to ~0.8% of GDP per year, but that these legislations have effectively improved water quality in the US. They also criticize the lack of research on water pollution in the economics literature. (2) Isen, Rossin-Slater, and Walker (2017) determine through a quasi-experiment (regression discontinuity) that lower levels of air pollution in the early childhood improve labor market performance in adults. (3) Deschênes, Greenstone, and Shapiro (2017) uses an instrumental variable design. Some counties have no power plants which emit NOX–and hence exhibit no NOX pollution in summer. They find that reducing NOX emissions by one million tons per year will save about $0.5 billion in medication expenditures, and prevent 3,100 premature summertime deaths (which economists value at $2.1 billion…). (4) Fabra and Reguant (2014) finds that power companies fully pass through the cost associated cap-and-trade programs to consumers via electricity prices in the absence of proper market design. All of these works are impressive and change the way we think about pollution.

The problem with using new software is that a lot of the features I desire are not there yet. In this case, I got a little bit too impatient maybe and went on github to report issues, and make feature requests. Since resources are limited, a lot of my reports have not been picked up yet, but one was. Being an early adapter is always a challenge, and reporting issues is part of that. On the one hand, I don't want to ask too much from open source developers. On the other hand, feedback from early adapters is what open source developers need in order to know in what direction to go. So it's some neat feedback for me to see that one of my reported issues became part of the (milestone 1.2 for R distill)[https://github.com/rstudio/distill/milestone/2]. I hope as a user I am contributing by reporting issues, and not just being a pain for the developers.",

Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker was determined to approve the project, it seems. This story raises the question of what factors determine whether a pipeline project is approved. Since their 1999 policy revision, [FERC has approved 400 applications for pipeline projects, and has rejected only 2](https://www.analysisgroup.com/uploadedfiles/content/insights/publishing/ag_ferc_natural_gas_pipeline_certification.pdf). There are public input opportunities built into the certification process, but in practice these only serve to \"inform\" the public of a decision that has already been made.",
